This project was created as a practical test or technical challenge for the frontend position at Mercado Libre. It is a simple project that has two main directories, one is the server, in which endpoints were built to expose to the front, and the other directory is the client, which contains the most complex part developed in the practical test. The project consists of a simulation of the real Meli page, where we can search for products, look and choose from a list of 4 items, and select the product to see the product details.

Atomic Design was used as the methodology to build the application, thinking about scalability. Redux Toolkit was implemented for managing the state of the application.
